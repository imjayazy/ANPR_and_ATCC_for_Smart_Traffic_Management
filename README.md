### ANPR_and_ATCC_for_Smart_Traffic_Management

An AI-powered traffic management system designed to efficiently handle real-time traffic at junctions using Automatic Traffic Counting and Classification (ATCC) and Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR). The system dynamically manages traffic signals based on real-time data, reducing congestion and improving traffic flow.

### Features
1.Helmet Detection:

--> Identifies riders not wearing helmets to ensure traffic safety compliance.

2.Triple Riding Detection:

--> Detects instances of more than two riders on a two-wheeler.

3.Accident Detection:

--> Recognizes accidents in real-time to trigger alerts for quicker response.

4.Heatmap Visualization:

--> Displays traffic density and congestion hotspots in a visual format.

5.Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR):

--> Detects and recognizes vehicle license plates for tracking and monitoring purposes.

6.Automatic Traffic Counting and Classification (ATCC):

--> Counts and classifies vehicles in real-time for better traffic management.

7.Dynamic Signal Controlling:

--> Adjusts traffic signals dynamically based on real-time vehicle counts on each road.
